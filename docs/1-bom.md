# bill of materials

before you get started, make sure you have the following parts to build your plondo. all parts are through hole unless
otherwise specified.

- 1x plondo PCB set
    - this includes the switch plate, base plate, and main pcb
- 1x atmega32a-p
- 1x 40 pin IC socket
- 48x 1N4148 diodes
- 2x 3.6V zener diodes
- 2x 100nF capacitors
- 1x 4.7uF capacitor
- 2x 20pF capacitors
- 1x USB-4085
- 1x 500mA 5mm pitch fuse
- 1x 16MHz crystal
- 2x push buttons
- 4x LEDs (1 power, 3 indicator)
- 3x 10k ohm resistors
- 4x 1.5k ohm resistors
- 2x 5.1k ohm resistors
- 2x 75 ohm resistors
- 1x ec11 rotary encoder
    - probably also get a knob to go on it
- 48x kailh mx hotswap terminals
- 48x mx compatible switches
- 1x ssd1306 128x32 oled screen
- 1x 2x3 2.54mm pin header
- 14x m2 screws
- 9x m2 spacers (TODO: figure out the sizes we need. 4 for the middle of the board, 5 for the top)
- 1x acrylic cover (optional)

you should probably also have the following tools

- soldering iron
- solder sucker and wick
    - just to clean up joints and desolder if you make mistakes. skip this if you're a giga-chad
- tweezers
- flux
    - this is for the usb c port. good luck without it
- ISP
    - i use a usbasp programmer, these things are super cheap online just make sure you have one for the bootloader
- small screwdriver
- multimeter
    - optional, but helpful for testing your soldering if you think it's dodgy

now that you have all the pieces you need, time to [start building](2-build-guide.md)
